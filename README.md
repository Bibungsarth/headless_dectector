Headless Browser Detection

This project contains JavaScript code designed to detect headless browsers by analyzing various browser behaviors and anomalies. Headless browsers, often used for automation and scraping, can exhibit different characteristics compared to regular browsers with graphical user interfaces. By leveraging these differences, this code aims to identify potential headless browser activity.
Overview

The detection logic is based on a combination of rendering anomalies, screen and window properties, and timing discrepancies. The code includes several key functions that work together to detect headless browsers:
Functions

  detectRenderingAnomalies()
        Purpose: Detects anomalies related to CSS rendering and script execution speed.
        Checks:
            CSS pseudo-element rendering.
            Script execution time for a simple loop.

  detectScreenAndWindowAnomalies()
        Purpose: Detects unusual screen and window dimensions, positions, and absence of resize events.
        Checks:
            Screen size.
            Window size.
            Window position.
            Window resize events.

  detectTimeBasedAnomalies()
        Purpose: Detects unusually fast script execution and user interaction times.
        Checks:
            Script execution time.
            Interaction time for a simulated button click.

  detectHeadlessBrowser()
        Purpose: Orchestrates the detection process by combining the results of the above functions.
        Outcome: Logs whether a headless browser is detected or not.


To use this detection script, simply include the JavaScript code in your web application. The detectHeadlessBrowser() function will automatically execute upon script load and log the detection results in the console.

Contributions to enhance the detection logic or add new features are welcome. Please feel free to submit pull requests or open issues for discussion.
